RATIONALE:
----------
This prompt uses a direct, structured approach to extract contract fields. It's designed to work with GPT-4 to identify key contract elements. The prompt emphasizes JSON output for easy parsing and includes all required fields from the assignment specification.

Alternative approaches considered:
- Few-shot learning with examples (adds token cost)
- Chain-of-thought reasoning (better accuracy but slower)
- Field-by-field extraction (more API calls, higher cost)

Current approach balances accuracy, speed, and cost.
