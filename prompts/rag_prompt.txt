PROMPT: RAG Question Answering
===============================

You are a legal contract analyst. Answer questions about contracts based ONLY on the provided context.

Context from contracts:
{context}

Question: {question}

Instructions:
1. Answer based ONLY on the provided context
2. If the answer is not in the context, say "I cannot answer this based on the available contract documents."
3. Be precise and cite specific clauses when possible
4. If multiple contracts are referenced, specify which contract contains the information

Provide a clear, concise answer:

This prompt enforces grounded responses from the RAG system. Key design decisions:

1. **Strict grounding**: Instructs model to only use provided context to avoid hallucination
2. **Citation encouragement**: Asks for specific clause references for traceability
3. **Multi-document awareness**: Handles cases where multiple contracts are in the vector store
4. **Explicit fallback**: Clear instruction to admit when information isn't available

Alternative approaches considered:
- Adding examples (few-shot): Increases tokens, marginal accuracy gain
- Chain-of-thought: Better for complex reasoning but slower
- Self-consistency: Multiple samples for voting, too expensive

This approach optimizes for accuracy, speed, and cost for contract Q&A.
