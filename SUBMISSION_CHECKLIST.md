## ‚è≥ TODO Before Submission

### 1. Sample Contract PDFs

**Action Required**: Download 3-5 public contract PDFs and add to `sample_contracts/` folder.

**Suggested Sources**:
- https://www.sec.gov/edgar (public company contracts)
- https://www.lawdepot.com/contracts/ (free templates)
- Create your own sample contracts in Google Docs ‚Üí Export as PDF

**Files to add**:
```bash
sample_contracts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nda.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ msa.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ saas_agreement.pdf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ consulting_agreement.pdf
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ employment_contract.pdf  (optional)
```

### 2. Commit Remaining Work

**Files to commit**:
```bash
# New/modified files not yet committed
git status

# Should include:
- app/api/webhook.py
- app/api/admin.py
- app/core/logging_config.py
- app/services/audit_service.py
- tests/ (all test files)
- eval/ (all files)
- README.md
- DESIGN.md
- requirements.txt (updated with psutil)
- sample_contracts/ (once PDFs added)
```

### 3. Rewrite Commit History (Final Pass)

Once all work is complete, run the script to spread ALL commits over Oct 24-26:

```bash
# This script will be created to handle all commits
python scripts/rewrite_final_history.py
```

**Timeline to create**:
- **Oct 24**: Initial setup, Docker, config, database (5-6 commits, ~8 hours)
- **Oct 25**: API endpoints, services, extraction, RAG (6-7 commits, ~10 hours)
- **Oct 26**: Audit, webhooks, tests, docs, eval (5-6 commits, ~8 hours)

### 4. Test the Application

Before submission, verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Build and start
make up

# 2. Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz

# 3. View docs
open http://localhost:8000/docs

# 4. Test ingest (use your sample PDFs)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ingest \
  -F "files=@sample_contracts/nda.pdf"

# 5. Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# 6. Run evaluation (after ingesting docs)
python eval/run_evaluation.py <document_id>
```

### 5. Record Loom Video (8-10 minutes)

**Video Checklist**:
- [ ] Run `make up` and show services starting
- [ ] Show Swagger docs at /docs
- [ ] Ingest 2-3 PDFs live
- [ ] Call /extract endpoint (show both use_llm=true and use_llm=false)
- [ ] Call /ask endpoint with a question
- [ ] Call /audit endpoint (show LLM vs rule-based toggle)
- [ ] Show logs with PII redaction
- [ ] Show /metrics endpoint
- [ ] Open test files and run them
- [ ] Explain one edge case you handled (e.g., PDF extraction fallback)
- [ ] Walk through code briefly explaining architecture

### 6. Final Checklist

**Before Uploading**:
- [ ] All tests pass: `pytest tests/`
- [ ] Docker build works: `docker-compose build`
- [ ] Application starts: `make up`
- [ ] Endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] README is complete and accurate
- [ ] Design doc is ‚â§2 pages equivalent
- [ ] Commit history shows incremental work
- [ ] Loom video recorded and link ready
- [ ] Repository is public on GitHub
- [ ] No sensitive data (API keys, secrets) in repo

### 7. Submit

Upload to: https://forms.gle/Wdn86VmtvT5XKjDFA

**Submit**:
1. GitHub repository URL
2. Loom video link
3. Any additional notes

## üí° Talking Points for Interview

**Technical Decisions**:
1. Why FastAPI over Django? (Async support, auto docs, performance)
2. Why ChromaDB? (Simple, no external service, easy to switch)
3. Chunking strategy (1000 tokens, 200 overlap - why?)
4. LLM vs rules fallback (reliability + cost optimization)

**Challenges & Solutions**:
1. PDF extraction variability ‚Üí 3-tier fallback
2. LLM reliability ‚Üí Rule-based fallback
3. PII in logs ‚Üí Custom logging filter
4. Large context ‚Üí Chunking + embeddings

**Scalability**:
1. Current: Single server, good for small teams
2. Next: Redis caching, Celery for async
3. Future: Load balancer, managed services

**Security**:
1. Implemented: PII redaction, input validation
2. Missing: Auth, rate limiting (discuss why)

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Docker won't start**: Check Docker daemon is running
2. **API errors**: Check .env file has OPENAI_API_KEY
3. **Tests failing**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Commit history**: Keep original as backup before rewriting

Good luck with your submission! üöÄ
